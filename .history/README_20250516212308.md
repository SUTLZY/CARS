# CARS: Context-Aware Reinforcement Learning Strategies for Autonomous and Adaptive Systems

## Overview
**CARS** is a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to enhance adaptability and effectiveness in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Traditional RL methods struggle with non-static settings due to their reliance on fixed transition dynamics and reward functions. CARS overcomes these challenges by integrating context-aware inference and adaptive decision-making strategies.

**Status:** This project is part of ongoing research. The related paper is currently under submission.

## Key Features
- **Context-Aware Inference Network (CAIN):** Dynamically infers latent context shifts from observational data.
- **Belief Markov Decision Process (MDP):** Optimizes decision-making using inferred belief contexts.
- **Forward Dynamics Model:** Improves generalization to unseen dynamics.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):** Reinforcement learning algorithm used for policy optimization.
- **Robust Performance:** Demonstrated effectiveness in handling sudden environmental changes.

## Architecture
1. **Context Inference:** CAIN processes observational data to detect environmental shifts.
2. **Belief-Based Decision Making:** The inferred context guides policy adaptation using a belief MDP framework.
3. **Generalization Enhancement:** A forward dynamics model improves adaptability to unseen conditions.
4. **PPO-based Optimization:** Reinforcement learning is performed using PPO for stable policy updates.
